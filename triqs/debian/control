Description: TRIQS (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems)
 is a scientific project providing a set of C++ and Python libraries to
 develop new tools for the study of interacting quantum systems.
 .
 The goal of this toolkit is to provide high level, efficient and simple
 to use libraries in C++ and Python, and to promote the use of modern
 programming techniques.
